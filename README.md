## Warning: Project abandoned.

## Considering the news of MHF shutting down, I have decided to cancel further development of this software. The code is here and it's open for scrutiny should anyone want to use it for something. 

## Thank you to everyone who supported this project.

MHFTranslate is a small console application that automatically parses the logs from Monster Hunter Frontier and translates
it using Google's Cloud Translation API. This is a WORK IN PROGRESS/PROOF OF CONCEPT.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing. If you need a
compiled binary, see "Precompiled Binaries" instead.

## Prerequisites
This project makes use of the following NuGet packages:
```
Google.Cloud.Translation.V2
dein.Colorify
Newtonsoft.Json
```

Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. To use this software you need your own Google Cloud Services API key. As the project has been abandoned, I am no longer providing an API key that can be used for this program.

## Usage
To use MHFTranslate, make sure the game is open and that you've spent enough time in a lobby for a log to be written. Then, open the program and it will start reading & translating automatically. It currently requires to be running in a separate window, although an overlay will be considered for Version 2 if it gathers enough interest.
